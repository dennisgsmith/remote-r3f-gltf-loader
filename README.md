# remote-r3f-gltf-loader
A repo set up for a friend, to demonstrate loading remote, interactive 3D assets as [GLTFs in the browser with React-Three-Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/tutorials/loading-models) (a React wrapper for the Three.js 3D modeling library). Makes for easier deployment than throwing them into the public folder only to migrate them to a remote source later on.
